    !--- HOW TO DEAL WITH INCOMPLETE TRACKS--------

    ! Usually two to four tracks neighboring are used for interpolation.
    ! However, if any of them is incomplete,
    ! then the interpolated track is also rendered incomplete.
    ! If fix_track is true, METISSE relaxes the criteria for finding
    ! the neighboring tracks in above cases and tries to get a complete track.
    
    fix_track = .true.

    ! if fix_track is true, then
    ! the completeness of tracks is determined by the following two:
    
    ! for stars with M< Mec
    low_mass_final_eep = -1
    ! for stars with M>= Mec
    high_mass_final_eep = -1

    ! When fixing an incomplete track
    ! Search for the new neighboring tracks for interpolation
    ! within the mass range of initial_mass - (initial_mass*lookup_index)
    ! and initial_mass + (initial_mass*lookup_index)]
 
    lookup_index = 1.0
