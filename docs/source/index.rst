Welcome to METISSE's documentation!
===================================

**METISSE** is an acronym for **MET**\ hod of **I**\ nterpolation for **S**\ ingle **S**\ tar **E**\ volution. It is a code package designed for rapidly computing the evolution of a large number of stars by interpolating within a set of pre-computed evolutionary tracks. The input tracks for interpolation are computed from stellar structure and evolution codes such as MESA. It is important that the input tracks should be in EEP format, meaning that significant evolutionary points like zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) should occur at the same line number across each file. METISSE can be used as a standalone code or in conjunction with other codes for evolving populations of single and binary stars.


**Prequisite:** METISSE requires gcc/6.4.0 or above

The code package is available `here <https://github.com/TeamMETISSE/METISSE>`_

In addition to above, METISSE also requires a set of EEP tracks with a given metallicity to interpolate a stellar track for the same metallicity and a specific mass.
EEP tracks for a range of mass and metallicity, computed using MESA, and ready for use with METISSE can be downloaded from this link. 

After downloading, the path of this folder should be provided to METISSE. This path and other inputs should be provided to METISSE depending on how METISSE is used (in standalone mode or in conjunction with other codes).

More details including code capabilities are described in:
