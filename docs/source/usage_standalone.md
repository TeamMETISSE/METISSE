# Using METISSE as a standalone code 

## Supplying input 

In the standalone mode values of mass, metallicity and other input parameters
are supplied using `SSE_input_controls` namelist contained in *evolve_metisse.in* file. 

```
&SSE_input_controls

  ! EVOLUTION CONTROLS
   
    ! For reading input masses for new tracks
    read_mass_from_file = .false.      

    input_mass_file = ''

    number_of_tracks = 0

    max_mass = -1.0

    min_mass = -1.0
    
    initial_Z = -1.0

    ! Maximum age in Myrs
    max_age = -1.0   

  ! REMNANT CONTROLS


    ! Options - "Mestel", "Modified_mestel"
    WD_mass_scheme = 'Modified_mestel'

    
    ! Only for White Dwarfs
    Use_initial_final_mass_relation = .false.       


    ! Options - "original_SSE", "Belczynski2002", "Belczynski2008", "Eldridge_Tout2004"
    BHNS_mass_scheme = 'Belczynski2008'

    
    ! Maximum neutron star mass 
    ! Suggested 1.8 for BHNS_mass_scheme="original_SSE", 3.0 otherwise

    Max_NS_mass = 3.d0
   
    ! Allow electron capture supernovae

    allow_electron_capture = .true.       
    
  ! TIMESCALE CONTROLS

    pts_1 = 0.05
    pts_2 = 0.01
    pts_3 = 0.02

  !OUTPUT CONTROLS

    ! 'write_track_to_file' generates an SSE-style output file 
    ! only at the END of the evolution

    write_track_to_file = .true.

/

/ ! end of SSE_controls inlist

```

`SSE_input_controls` is only used in standalone mode, it is ignored otherwise and input parameters provided by the overlying code are used.  

*evolve_metisse.in* also contains another Fortran namelist `METISSE_input_controls`. This namelist contains input parameters specific to METISSE, including `metallicity_file_list`.


```
&METISSE_input_controls

    ! A metallicity file contains details about 
    ! the set of input tracks for a given metallicity,
    ! such as the path to the folder, their metallicity value
    ! and other information/metadata (see metallicity_defaults.in)

    ! The option 'metallicity_file_list' is used for providing 
    ! path/location of that metallicity file.
    ! In the case of a grid of stellar tracks,
    ! with folders containing tracks of various metallicities,
    ! location of the metallicity file for each folder/metallicity
    ! can be provided as a list of comma-separated strings 
    ! for up to 20 metallicities.
    ! For example: metallicity_file_list = 'path1',
    !                                      'path2',
    !                                       ...
    !                                      'path20'

    
    metallicity_file_list = ''


    ! if (abs(Z_input-Z_required)/MIN(Z_input,Z_required)) > Z_accuracy_limit
    Z_accuracy_limit = 1d-2

    ! INTERPOLATION CONTROLS

    ! Skip interpolation in mass if there is already
    ! an input track with initial_mass within the 'mass_accuracy_limit'

    mass_accuracy_limit = 1d-4

    ! OTHER REMNANT CONTROLS
    ! If true, 'construct_wd_track' is used (for low-mass stars) to construct the track between 
    ! Thermally-Pulsating AGB phase or tip of the AGB to the white dwarf cooling track
    ! It is useful if input tracks do not contain this phase
    ! but can be used otherwise too.

    construct_wd_track = .true.

    
    ! OUTPUT CONTROLS

    ! if true, 'verbose' prints useful details when reading the files

    verbose = .false. 

    ! 'write_eep_file' generates MIST style output file 
    ! at EVERY step of mass interpolation
    ! useful for debugging and single-star evolution calculations with implicit mass loss

    write_eep_file = .false.    

    !OUTPUT_DIR = ''

/

```

Both are Fortran namelists, so comments (!) and blank lines can be used freely. Characters are **case-insensitive**. Although make sure to leave a blank line at the end of the file (after the `/` symbol)

Refer to `src/defaults/evolve_metisse_defaults.inc` for variable names and their default values. **Do not modify any file inside the defaults folder**.

## Running METISSE 

*makefile* in folder *make* contains all necessary instructions to compile METISSE in the standalone mode. 

Just do `./mk` to compile the package.

To run METISSE in the standalone mode, simply do:

`./metisse`

<!-- METISSE will evolve a 1 M$_\odot$ star, of input metallicity upto 10 Gyr for you. :blush: -->

Check *output* directory for output data files.

## Output 

METISSE can produce two types of output files in the standalone mode:

**1. files ending with .dat :**

SSE-like output files, controlled by `write_track_to_file` in SSE_input_controls.
These contain the following stellar parameters until max_age. Time and age at hydrogen ZAMS are assumed to be zero.

| Column Header | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| time | Physical time [Myr] |
| age | Age of star [Myr] |
| mass | Current mass of the star [M$_\odot$] |
| core_mass | Mass of dominant core [M$_\odot$] |
| He_core | Mass of helium core [M$_\odot$] |
| CO_core | Mass of carbon-oxygen core [M$_\odot$] |
| log_L | Log of surface luminosity [L$_\odot$] |
| log_Teff | Log of effective temperature [K] |
| log_radius | Log of radius [R$_\odot$] |
| phase | SSE stellar type/phase |
| e | Extra information about WD track (to be removed in future) |



**2. files ending with .eep :**

For debugging purposes, METISSE can write a mass-interpolated track to an output file with the same columns as input files (plus a phase column) and a MIST-style file structure. 
This output file only contains data from ZAMS to the end of nuclear-burning phases, i.e., it does not contain information about the remnant phase. 
It is controlled by `write_eep_file` in METISSE_input_controls.
