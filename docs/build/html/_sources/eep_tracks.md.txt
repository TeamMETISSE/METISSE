# Using custom input tracks

METISSE, can use any set of tracks computed with MESA or other stellar evolution codes. 
Prior to use in METISSE, the input tracks need to be converted to EEP format, ensuring that key evolutionary points, such as the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), are aligned across all files. 

Information about EEP tracks is then provided through the `&metallicity_controls` inlist, which we also call as the `metallicity file`. Each metallicity file contains details about the input tracks for a specific metallicity, including the path to the folder containing the EEP tracks, the metallicity value, and other relevant information or metadata.

```
&metallicity_controls
    ! Location of the folder containing input files for a given metallicity

    INPUT_FILES_DIR = ''

    ! Metallicity of input tracks
    ! It is only used to cross-check 
    ! against input Z to avoid mistakes
    
    Z_files = -1.0

    ! Details about the file structure (see format_defaults.dat)
    ! Empty string will raise an error

    format_file = ''

    ! Interpolating in all columns of input files can slow down computations 
    ! By default METISSE only interpolates in the essential columns 
    ! and the additional columns specified in the format_file.
    ! Using fewer columns means fewer calculations, therefore faster runs.
    ! If read_all_columns is true then all columns are used.
    
    read_all_columns = .false.

    ! NOTE that for binary evolution calculations, ONLY default columns are used,
    ! irrespective of whether read_all_columns is true or not.
    ! Quantities interpolated using any other columns are currently discarded.


    ! Extra columns to be used for interpolation if read_all_columns is false 
    ! Useful only for single-star evolution calculations with implicit mass loss.
    
    ! The interpolated quantities are printed in MIST (Choi et al. 2016) style files
    ! if write_eep_file is true.
    ! You can list up to 100 column names here, as strings separated by a comma 
    ! (irrespective of the order or whitespace between the strings).

    extra_columns = ''

    ! Alternatively, you can list the extra columns names in a text file 
    ! (one column name per line) and specify the location of that file in extra_columns_file
    
    extra_columns_file = ''

  
    ! Z PARAMETERS/ mass cutoffs
    ! If < 0 then the values are calculated by the code
    ! If>0 then these values are instead used 

    Mhook = -1.0
    Mhef = -1.0
    Mfgb = -1.0
    Mup = -1.0
    Mec = -1.0

    ! Extra mass cutoff- if any

    Mextra = -1.0       

    ! Hydrogen and helium abundance
    ! Default is SSE formulae
    ! If Z_H <0 then it is calculated from Z as 0.76 - 3*Z
    ! If Z_He <0 then it is calculated from Z as 0.24 + 2*Z

    Z_H = -1.0
    Z_He = -1.0

```

In addition to the metallicity files, user also needs to specify the format of input files through `&format_controls` inlist. An example format file looks like this: 


```
&format_controls

    !-------FILE DETAILS-------------
    
    ! e.g., '.eep','.dat'
    file_extension = ''
    
    ! Set read_eep_files to true only for MIST-like files
    ! generated from A Dotter's ISO code (Dotter 2016).
    ! If true; then extra_char, total_cols
    ! and other information are can be read directly from files.
    ! Set it to false other type of files

    read_eep_files = .false.
    
    ! Header for reading column names from files
    ! i.e. the line number where column names are listed
    ! Set it to <=0 if the input files do not contain column names
    ! and list the names in the column_name_file
   
    header_location = -1
    
    ! Any extra character present in the header line (if any)
    
    extra_char = ''

    ! If the header is <=0, then column names cannot be determined from the input files
    ! For such cases, specify 'column_name_file' for determining the name and the order of columns
    ! Note that this is different from the key_columns_file which specifies what subset of these columns is to be used

    column_name_file = ''
    
    ! Total number of columns
    
    total_cols = -1

    !--- HOW TO DEAL WITH INCOMPLETE TRACKS--------

    ! Usually two to four tracks neighboring are used for interpolation.
    ! However, if any of them is incomplete,
    ! then the interpolated track is also rendered incomplete.
    ! If fix_track is true, METISSE relaxes the criteria for finding
    ! the neighboring tracks in above cases and tries to get a complete track.
    
    fix_track = .true.

    ! if fix_track is true, then
    ! the completeness of tracks is determined by the following two:
    
    ! for stars with M< Mec
    low_mass_final_eep = -1
    ! for stars with M>= Mec
    high_mass_final_eep = -1

    ! When fixing an incomplete track
    ! Search for the new neighboring tracks for interpolation
    ! within the mass range of initial_mass - (initial_mass*lookup_index)
    ! and initial_mass + (initial_mass*lookup_index)]
 
    lookup_index = 1.0

    !----------- EEP DETAILS for He stars----------
    ! Use the following syntax to provide he stars eeps in your format file

Similar to `&SSE_input_controls` and `&METISSE_input_controls`, refer to `src/defaults/metallicity_defaults.inc` and `src/defaults/format_defaults.inc` for most upto date variable names for all inlists and their default values. **Do not modify any file inside the defaults folder**.
